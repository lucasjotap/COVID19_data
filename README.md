# COVID DATA Project

This project makes the use of few cool tools in Python and SQL.

During this project we'll analyze some import data points about the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years or so.

We'll also create a world map to visualize how many total cases per country.

The entire project is aimed at analyzing data from COVID-19 and try to get some interesting information from it.

In our SQL queries, one can find several patterns for a large array of questions such as "Most affected places", "Amount of total cases", "People vaccinated" and much more. The data is very extensive and could be studied for a long time in order to pull interesting information about the current and past status of the entire history of COVID-19. 

Some technologies we used on this project:

`Python` >> `pygal` in order to create our World map.
`SQL` to query the data we pulled from the web in csv format.
`Vscode` to write our Python code.
`DBeaver` to work with our SQL queries in a more organized manner.

Also it's important to note that we used a Python virtual environment to contain all of the dependencies this project needed to come into fruition.
